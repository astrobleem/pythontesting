Shows you a shadowed pokemon, when you press a button it records your speech
then transcribes your speech to text
then compares your spoken text to the answer to let you know if you got it right or wrong.
it also shows you who the pokemon is anyway
and then it will speak and display some pokedex information about that pokemon.

Please don't sue me, Nintendo, or the pokemon company!
